This project aims to produce inexpensive, open source hardware for the scientific community, often based on designs of the Voron project or other open-source communities.
The mewron repository contains the CAD files and instructions to set up an independent extruder motor necessary for the conversion of a Voron 0.1 to a melt electrowriting (MEW) printer, the MEWron.
If you use the files in this repository for scientific work, we kindly ask you to cite the following publication that fully describes the MEWron and its capabilities:
